# Changelog

## [0.0.1] — Your desktop AI coding companion is here

The first public release of BetterCode — a local-first desktop app that gives you a proper workspace for coding with AI agents.

Think of it as a native home for Claude, Codex, OpenCode that actually understands your projects, your git workflow, and your terminal.

### Added

- **Plan mode** — Claude reads your code and designs an approach before touching anything
- **Agent mode** — Claude goes full hands-on: edits files, runs commands, searches the web
- **Ralph mode** — Give it a PRD with user stories and let it build features autonomously
- Git worktree isolation per chat — every conversation gets its own branch, no conflicts
- Real-time diff view as Claude makes changes
- One-click PRs to GitHub and GitLab
- Stage, commit, and push without leaving the app
- Built-in PTY terminal (xterm) — see what commands run and jump in anytime
- Live preview with device presets (iPhone, iPad, Android) for responsive testing
- Multi-provider AI support: Claude (Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5), OpenAI Codex, OpenCode
- Extended thinking support (128K tokens of reasoning)
- MCP servers for custom tool integrations
- Sub-chat tabs — explore different approaches simultaneously within one chat
- Pin and archive conversations
- 16+ themes including VSCode-compatible and Liquid Glass (macOS vibrancy)
- Full keyboard navigation (`⌘\`, `⌘⇧\`, `Ctrl+Tab`, and more)
