# BetterCode v0.0.1 — Your desktop AI coding companion is here

# BetterCode v0.0.1 🎉

The first public release of BetterCode — a local-first desktop app that gives you a proper workspace for coding with AI agents.

Think of it as a native home for Claude (and other AI providers) that actually understands your projects, your git workflow, and your terminal.

## What you get

**Three ways to work with AI:**
- **Plan mode** — Claude reads your code and designs an approach before touching anything
- **Agent mode** — Claude goes full hands-on: edits files, runs commands, searches the web
- **Ralph mode** — Give it a PRD with user stories and let it build features autonomously

**Git-native workflow:**
- Every chat gets its own git worktree — isolated branches, no conflicts
- Real-time diff view as Claude makes changes
- One-click PRs to GitHub and GitLab
- Stage, commit, and push without leaving the app

**Built-in terminal:**
- Full PTY terminal (xterm) integrated right in the app
- See exactly what commands Claude runs and their output
- Jump in and run your own commands anytime

**Live preview:**
- Embedded browser preview for frontend work
- Device presets (iPhone, iPad, Android) for responsive testing
- Auto-refreshes as code changes

**Multi-provider AI:**
- Claude (Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5)
- OpenAI Codex
- OpenCode
- Extended thinking support (128K tokens of reasoning)
- MCP servers for custom tool integrations

**Parallel conversations:**
- Sub-chat tabs within each chat — explore different approaches simultaneously
- Pin important conversations
- Archive completed work

**Looks good too:**
- 16+ themes including VSCode-compatible ones
- Liquid Glass themes with macOS vibrancy
- Full keyboard navigation (`⌘\`, `⌘⇧\`, `Ctrl+Tab`, and more)

## Platform support

- macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel)
- Windows
- Linux (AppImage + DEB)

## What this is NOT (yet)

This is v0.0.1. It's early. Things will break. We're shipping fast and iterating based on feedback. If you find bugs or have ideas, open an issue — we're listening.

Built with Electron, React 19, and a lot of ☕
